# Spell-Checker
Made using distribution code from the Harvard CS50 course. Learned how to use pointers in C and how to create a hash table using a hash function. The idea of collision was also explored through linked lists. 

Texts folder contains sample texts that can be spell checked, and the keys folder holds corresponding answers for verification.
